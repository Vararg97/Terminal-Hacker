# Terminal-Hacker
Hi! U eat michrochips.

## Description
This is a game where you have to "hack" into the terminal by guessing the correct code word for the scrambled image that is presented.  

### TODO
* Add more images/codes with calid synonyms

### Feature Requests
* Scoring - add a score for each successful hack conducted in a row.  Any failures, resets to 0. <-- #1 PRIORITY
* Consider adding hints to be displayed on each failed attempt during a hack.  If this is added, then change scoring to be weighted by total hints used.
